## Description

In this project, we got cracking on our first Laravel app! What I made was an app called "Developers Best Friend". This app contains a Lorem Ipsum text generator, as well as a random user generator. For both apps, all you have to do is fill in how many paragraphs/users you would like to generate, with a maximum of 25, and then hit generate, and the data is returned on the next page. hit the generator button at the top to create more random data.
